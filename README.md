# Vegetable Prices Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of vegetable prices, providing insights into trends, seasonal variations, and potential applications for data-driven decision-making in agriculture and retail.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle: [Vegetable Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ksamiksha19/vegetable-prices). It includes data about the prices of various vegetables over time, with features such as:

- **Date**: When the price was recorded.
- **Vegetable**: Type of vegetable (e.g., Tomato, Potato, Onion, etc.).
- **Price**: Price per unit (currency unspecified).
- **Other Features**: Additional columns, if available, that provide contextual information.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Standardize date formats and data types.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand price distributions.
   - Identify trends and patterns over time.
   - Analyze price variations across different vegetables.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Time-series plots for price trends.
   - Comparative analysis across vegetables using bar and box plots.

4. **Insights and Applications**:
   - Seasonal price changes and market trends.
   - Recommendations for stakeholders like farmers, retailers, and policymakers.

## Tools and Libraries

This project uses the following tools and libraries:

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda

## Workflow

1. **Data Import and Cleaning**: Load the dataset and ensure data integrity.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize data distribution and outliers.
   - Identify trends and correlations.
3. **Modeling (Optional)**:
   - Use predictive modeling to forecast prices based on historical data.
4. **Visualization and Insights**: Generate actionable insights and present them effectively.

## Results

- Identification of peak price periods for specific vegetables.
- Visualization of long-term price trends.
- Seasonal variations in vegetable prices.

## How to Use

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoteneJan/Vegetable-Prices-Analysis.git
   cd Vegetable-Prices-Analysis
   ```

## Future Work

- Enhance the dataset with additional features like weather data and production volumes.
- Implement advanced time-series forecasting models.
- Build a dashboard for real-time price tracking.
